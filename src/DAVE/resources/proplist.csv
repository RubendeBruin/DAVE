            1. Circles can not be used as endpoins. If one of the endpoints is a Circle then the Point that that circle
            is located on is used instead.
            2. Points should not be repeated directly.

        The following will fail:
        c.connections = ('point 1', 'point 3', 'circle 1')

        because the last point is a circle. So circle 1 will be replaced with the point that the circle is on: point 3.

        so this becomes
        ('point 1','point 3','point 3')

        this is invalid because point 3 is repeated.
